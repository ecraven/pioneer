* Current economy and politics (2020-03-04)
** Commodities
Each commodity has a name, a number of /inputs/ and an economic type (=MINING=, =AGRICULTURE= or =INDUSTRY=).

** Politics
/Government types/ consist of an /economic type/, a rarity and a /lawlessness/.
*** Economic type
- No-Established-Order (None)
- Hard-Capitalist (Very-Capitalist)
- Capitalist (Capitalist)
- Mixed-Economy (Mixed)
- Planned-Economy (Planned)
*** Government Type

| Plutocratic-Dictatorship       |      4 | Very-Capitalist | fixed(45, 100) |
| Violent-Anarchy                |      2 | None            | fixed(90, 100) |
** System Generation
StarSystemGenerator.cpp:1636 =void PopulateStarSystemGenerator::SetSysPolit= seems to be the relevant function.
- =SystemPath(0, 0, 0, 0)= is hard-coded as =EARTHDEMOC=.
- If =population= is zero, it is =NONE=.
- Otherwise, it is picked based on faction. If that fails, it is picked at random.
- Lawlessness is multiplied by a random number in [0,1].
*** Commodity Legality
Each system has a set of illegal commodities. (see StarSystemGenerator.cpp:1675 =void PopulateStarSystemGenerator::SetCommodityLegality=)
- If there is no government (type =NONE=), nothing is illegal.
- If there is a faction, set the legality based on the faction commodity legality rate (a chance that each commodity is illegal in a given system).
- Otherwise:
| Name           | Chance |
|----------------+--------|
| Hand-Weapons   | 1/2    |
| Battle-Weapons | 1/3    |
| Nerve-Gas      | 1/10   |
| Narcotics      | 1/2    |
| Slaves         | 1/16   |
*** Economic Type
- If a system has higher /Industrial/ than /Metallicity/ and higher /Industrial/ than /Agricultural/, it is *INDUSTRY*
- If it has higher /Metallicity/ than /Agricultural/, then it is *MINING*
- Otherwise it is *AGRICULTURAL*
